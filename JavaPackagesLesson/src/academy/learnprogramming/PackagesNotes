- Over 9 million Java developers worldwide
- class or interface name conflicts inevitable
- mechanisms needed to fully specify class
    - allows use of classes with same name in projects (or even same class)

- Programmers can easily determine that the classes are related
- easy to know where to find the classes and interfaces that can provide the functions
    provided by the package
- because the package creates a new namespace, class and interface name conflicts are
    avoided
- classes within the package have unrestricted access to one another while still restricting
    access for classes outside the package
