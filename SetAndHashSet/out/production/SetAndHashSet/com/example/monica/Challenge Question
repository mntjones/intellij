Challenge Question:

When overriding the equals() method in the HeavenlyBody class, we were careful to make sure
that it would not return true if a HEavenlyBody was compared to a subclass of itself.

We did that to demonstrate that method, but it was actually unnecessary in the HeavenlyBody
class. Why was it unnecessary?


Answer:
The HeavenlyBody class is declared final, so it can't be subclassed. The Java String class
is also final, which is why t can safely use the instanceOf method without having to worry
about comparisons with a subclass.
